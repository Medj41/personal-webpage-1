                    <h2>Hello, my name is Mohamed Larbi but you can call me Larbi!</h2>
                    <p>I’m originally from Algeria, a beautiful town in the east of Algeria called Souk Ahras. I’ve been living in Edinburgh, 
                        the capital of Scotland for the past few years and have been getting used to the cold cold weather up here.

                <p>My passions include cooking and football. I cannot miss a Real Madrid game!</p>
                <p>Zindine Zidane is my all time favourite football player, my favourite goal by 
                    him was at Champions league 2002 final.

                <p>I love cooking shakhshouka which is a traditional Algerian dish, it can be cooked with Lamb, Beef, Fish, Chicken or just vegetables.</p>

                <h1>Technology</h1>
                <p>I’m also really passionate about tech, I am the tech ambassador at my current job and help colleagues set up their computers and 
                answer any tech related questions. I have spent an entire weekend in front of my screen coding that’s how much I love it!
                One of the most exciting things I find about technology is its constant evolution and innovation. There are always new developments 
                and advancements being made, which means there are always new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. This means that a career
                 in tech is never stagnant or boring, as there is always something new to explore and discover. In addition, the tech industry is known 
                 for its diverse and inclusive culture, which fosters creativity and collaboration. Working in tech often means being part of a team of
                  highly motivated and talented individuals who share a passion for innovation and making a difference. This can lead to a sense of community
                   and belonging that is hard to find in other fields.
